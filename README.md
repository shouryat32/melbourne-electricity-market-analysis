> *Started with one question: is solar actually worth it in Melbourne?*

After hearing the same debate over and over, I decided to stop speculating and look at the data. The answer was clear — every Melbourne zone rates **A-tier** for solar viability against international benchmarks, with an average payback period of around **6 years**. But that answer opened a much bigger question: what's actually going on inside Victoria's electricity market? This project is that deeper investigation.

**3 years of Victorian grid data. 26,156 hours. A full medallion pipeline on Azure Databricks. Three ML models. One Power BI dashboard.**

## Key Findings

- 🕛 **Cheapest hour:** 12pm — avg wholesale price of $1.40/MWh
- 🕕 **Most expensive hour:** 6pm — avg $177.76/MWh (a $176/MWh spread)
- ⚡ **Negative pricing** (grid oversupply) occurred in **23% of all hours** over 3 years
- 🌡️ **Summer paradox** — on Victoria's hottest days, renewable generation actually *falls*. High-pressure systems kill wind speed, and solar gains don't compensate. Hot days (>25°C) average just **29% renewable** vs **55%** on cool days
- 🤖 **ML price model** achieves R² = 0.89 | **Demand model** R² = 0.98 | **Spike classifier** ROC-AUC = 0.99
